## Unique Features

### Professional Dashboard

```dart
class DashboardScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Today's appointments
          TodayAppointmentsList(),

          // Quick actions
          QuickActionsGrid(
            actions: [
              QuickAction(
                icon: Icons.calendar_today,
                title: 'Manage Schedule',
                onTap: () => context.push('/schedule'),
              ),
              QuickAction(
                icon: Icons.people,
                title: 'My Patients',
                onTap: () => context.push('/patients'),
              ),
              QuickAction(
                icon: Icons.analytics,
                title: 'Analytics',
                onTap: () => context.push('/analytics'),
              ),
            ],
          ),

          // Revenue summary
          RevenueSummaryCard(),

          // Upcoming appointments
          UpcomingAppointmentsList(),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Availability Management

```dart
class AvailabilityScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Manage Availability')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Week calendar view
          WeekCalendarView(),

          // Time slot editor
          TimeSlotEditor(
            onSlotAdded: (slot) {
              context.read<ScheduleBloc>().add(AddTimeSlot(slot));
            },
            onSlotRemoved: (slotId) {
              context.read<ScheduleBloc>().add(RemoveTimeSlot(slotId));
            },
          ),

          // Recurring slots
          RecurringSlotsList(),
        ],
