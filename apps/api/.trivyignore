# CVE-2024-23342 - Minerva timing attack on ecdsa
# Justification:
# - ecdsa is a transitive dependency of python-jose (not directly used)
# - We use python-jose[cryptography] which prioritizes pyca/cryptography backend
# - The cryptography backend does NOT use the vulnerable ecdsa library
# - python-ecdsa maintainers confirmed no fix will be released (out of project scope)
# - Mitigation: cryptography library handles all ECDSA operations securely
