## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Current vs Optimized

| Environment    | Current     | Optimized  | Savings  |
| -------------- | ----------- | ---------- | -------- |
| **Staging**    | $21-24/mo   | $5-8/mo    | **-70%** |
| **Production** | $83-140/mo  | $65-95/mo  | **-25%** |
| **TOTAL**      | $104-164/mo | $70-103/mo | **-35%** |

### Budget Compliance

| Environment | Current | Budget | Status         |
| ----------- | ------- | ------ | -------------- |
| Staging     | $21-24  | $10    | 🔴 **Over 2x** |
| Production  | $83-140 | $100   | 🟡 **At risk** |

### Top 3 Cost Optimizations

1. **Remove Load Balancer from Staging** → Save $18/month
2. **Reduce Production min-instances (2→1)** → Save $25/month
3. **Enable CPU throttling** → Save $5-10/month

**Total Potential Savings: $48-53/month (-35%)**

## 🚨 Risks & Mitigation

### High Risk

| Risk                              | Impact          | Probability | Mitigation                       |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Runaway costs** (no budgets)    | $1000+ bill     | Medium      | Implement budgets NOW            |
| **DDoS attack** (no rate limit)   | $500+ bill      | Medium      | Deploy Cloud Armor               |
| **Infrastructure drift** (no IaC) | Cannot rollback | High        | Create Terraform configs         |
| **Staging over budget**           | Waste $144/year | High        | Remove unnecessary Load Balancer |

### Medium Risk

| Risk                       | Impact                 | Mitigation           |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| Production min-instances=2 | $300/year waste        | Reduce to 1 instance |
| No monitoring              | Slow incident response | Create dashboards    |
| Missing secrets            | Deployment failures    | Document all secrets |

## 📝 Action Plan

### Week 1: Critical Items (Must Have)

**Priority 1: Cost Controls** ⏱️ 1-2 days

```bash
# Setup budgets
./scripts/setup-budgets.sh adyela-staging 10
./scripts/setup-budgets.sh adyela-production 100

# Monitor daily
./scripts/check-daily-costs.sh adyela-staging 0.33
./scripts/check-daily-costs.sh adyela-production 3.33
```

**Priority 2: Infrastructure as Code** ⏱️ 3-4 days

```
infrastructure/terraform/
├── modules/
│   ├── cloud-run/
│   ├── storage/
│   ├── networking/
│   └── budgets/
└── environments/
    ├── staging/
    └── production/
```

**Priority 3: Quick Cost Wins** ⏱️ 1 hour

```yaml
# .github/workflows/cd-production.yml
--min-instances=1        # Change from 2 → Save $25/mo
--max-instances=10       # Cap runaway costs
--cpu-throttling         # Enable → Save $5-10/mo
```

### Week 2: High Priority
