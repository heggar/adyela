# Feature Development Workflow - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the automated feature development workflow that integrates Task Master AI with Git branching, enforces quality gates at every stage, maintains HIPAA compliance, and automates security validation.

## What Has Been Implemented

### ✅ 1. Task Management Scripts

**Location**: `scripts/`

- **`task-start.sh`**: Automates feature branch creation from Task Master tasks
  - Creates descriptive feature branch using task title (e.g., `feature/implement-user-authentication`)
  - Updates task status to `in-progress`
  - Generates development checklist
  - Creates task context directory (.task-context/task-<id>/)

- **`task-complete.sh`**: Automates task completion workflow
  - Runs final quality validation
  - Updates task status to `done`
  - Logs completion notes in Task Master
  - Provides next steps for PR creation

- **`dev-setup.sh`**: One-time developer environment setup
  - Installs dependencies
  - Sets up Git hooks
  - Installs security tools (gitleaks)
  - Configures Task Master integration

### ✅ 2. Enhanced Git Hooks

**Location**: `.husky/`

- **`pre-commit`**: Enhanced with comprehensive validation
  - Runs lint-staged for automatic formatting
  - Type checks changed TypeScript files
  - Lints all changed files
  - Scans for secrets using gitleaks
  - Blocks build artifacts from commits

- **`commit-msg`**: Enhanced with automatic task linking
  - Enforces conventional commits via commitlint
  - Automatically appends Task #ID from task context directory
  - Falls back to extracting from branch name if needed
  - Ensures traceability between commits and tasks

### ✅ 3. Quality Validation System

**Location**: `scripts/quality-checks.sh`

Complete CI/CD validation that can run locally:

- **[1/10]** Code formatting (Prettier)
- **[2/10]** Linting (ESLint)
- **[3/10]** Type checking (TypeScript)
- **[4/10]** Python quality (Black, Ruff, MyPy)
- **[5/10]** Unit tests (≥65% coverage)
- **[6/10]** Integration tests
- **[7/10]** Build validation
- **[8/10]** Security audit (Bandit, npm audit)
- **[9/10]** License compliance
- **[10/10]** Secret scanning (gitleaks)

### ✅ 4. GitHub Integration

**Pull Request Template**: `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`

- Task reference linking
- Comprehensive checklists for:
  - Testing (unit, integration, E2E)
  - Security (HIPAA compliance, scans)
  - Code quality (coverage, linting, type checking)
  - Documentation updates
  - Pre-merge validation

**CI/CD Audit Logging**: `.github/workflows/ci-api.yml`

- Added HIPAA-compliant audit logging job
- Logs all CI execution details:
  - Timestamp, actor, trigger, ref, SHA
  - PR number and repository
  - All job results (lint, test, security, build)
- 7-year retention for compliance (2555 days)

### ✅ 5. Makefile Commands

**Location**: `Makefile`

New Task Master integration commands:

```bash
make task-start ID=5       # Start task #5
make task-complete ID=5    # Complete task #5
make task-next             # Show next available task
make task-list             # List all tasks
make quality-local         # Run full quality checks
make dev-setup             # Setup dev environment
```

### ✅ 6. Documentation

**Location**: `docs/guides/feature-workflow.md`

Comprehensive guide covering:

- Quick start (6 steps)
- Detailed workflow (9 phases)
- Quality gates at each stage
- HIPAA compliance requirements
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Best practices
- Command cheat sheet
- Success metrics

## Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: Task Selection (30 seconds)

```bash
make task-next
```

Shows next available task with all dependencies met.

### Stage 2: Feature Branch (10 seconds)

```bash
make task-start ID=5
# Example: Task #5 "Implement User Authentication"
# Creates: feature/implement-user-authentication
```

Creates descriptive branch, updates Task Master, generates checklist.

### Stage 3: Development (varies)

- Write tests first (TDD)
- Implement feature
- Commit frequently (hooks run automatically)

### Stage 4: Quality Validation (2-3 minutes)

```bash
make quality-local
```

Runs complete CI/CD validation suite locally.

### Stage 5: Task Completion (10 seconds)

```bash
make task-complete ID=5
```

Validates quality, updates Task Master, prepares for PR.

### Stage 6: Pull Request (1 minute)

```bash
git push origin feature/implement-user-authentication
```

Create PR via GitHub UI (template auto-fills with task reference).

### Stage 7: CI/CD Pipeline (10-15 minutes)

- Automated validation on GitHub Actions
- All checks must pass
- HIPAA audit log generated
- 2 approvals required

### Stage 8: Staging Deployment (automatic)

- Squash merge to staging
- Auto-deploy to GCP staging
- E2E tests
- Performance tests
- Security scan (OWASP ZAP)

### Stage 9: Production Release (manual)

- Create release PR from staging to main
- Final approval
- Tag with version
- Deploy to production
- Monitor metrics

## Quality Gates

### Local Pre-Commit

- **Speed**: < 30 seconds
- **Scope**: Changed files only
- **Blocks**: Secrets, build artifacts, lint errors

### Local Full Validation

- **Speed**: 2-3 minutes
- **Scope**: Complete validation (matches CI)
- **Blocks**: Any quality issue

### CI/CD Pipeline

- **Speed**: 10-15 minutes
- **Scope**: Full automated validation
- **Blocks**: Any test/security failure
- **Requirements**: All checks pass + 2 approvals

### Staging Post-Merge

- **Speed**: 15-20 minutes
- **Scope**: E2E, performance, security
- **Monitors**: Health, metrics, errors

## HIPAA Compliance

Audit trails at every stage:

- **Git commits**: Who, what, when (automatic)
- **CI/CD logs**: All results (7-year retention)
- **Deployments**: Version, approver, timestamp
- **GCP Access**: All PHI access logged

## Security Features

1. **Secret Scanning**: gitleaks prevents credential commits
2. **Dependency Audits**: npm audit + Bandit
3. **Container Scanning**: Trivy for Docker images
4. **License Compliance**: Automated license checking
5. **SAST**: Static analysis on every PR
6. **DAST**: OWASP ZAP in staging
