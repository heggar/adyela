## ⚠️ Blocked Task (Option 3)

### Option 3: Terraform Apply - BLOCKED ⚠️

**Command executed**: `terraform apply microservices.tfplan`

**Result**: Partially failed due to missing Docker images

### Errors Encountered

#### 1. Missing Docker Images (PRIMARY BLOCKER)

Cloud Run services cannot be created without container images:

```
❌ Image 'us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/adyela-staging/adyela/api-auth:latest' not found
❌ Image 'us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/adyela-staging/adyela/api-analytics:latest' not found
❌ Image 'us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/adyela-staging/adyela/adyela-patient-web-staging:latest' not found
❌ Image 'us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/adyela-staging/adyela/adyela-professional-web-staging:latest' not found
```

#### 2. CPU Configuration Error - FIXED ✅

```
❌ api-notifications: cpu < 1 not supported with concurrency > 1
✅ FIXED: Updated cpu_limit from "0.5" to "1" in microservices.tf
```

**File modified**: `infra/environments/staging/microservices.tf:238`

#### 3. Network Connectivity Errors (TRANSIENT)

```
⚠️ Pub/Sub: dial tcp: connect: no route to host
⚠️ Identity Platform: service enable request failed
```

These are transient network issues and will likely succeed on retry.

## 📋 What Was Successfully Created

Even though terraform apply failed for some services, the following resources
were **successfully created**:

### ✅ Successfully Created Resources

1. **Service Accounts**:
   - `api-admin-staging-sa@adyela-staging.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - `api-analytics-staging-sa@adyela-staging.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - `api-notifications-staging-sa@adyela-staging.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

2. **IAM Permissions**:
   - All required roles assigned to service accounts:
     - roles/cloudtrace.agent
     - roles/logging.logWriter
     - roles/monitoring.metricWriter
     - roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor
     - roles/datastore.user
     - roles/pubsub.subscriber (for analytics)
     - roles/bigquery.dataEditor (for analytics)

3. **Load Balancer Configuration** (from previous successful apply):
   - ✅ NEGs for microservices
   - ✅ Backend services
   - ✅ URL map with path-based routing
   - ✅ SSL certificate with all domains

## 🎯 Deployment Order: The Correct Sequence

To successfully deploy the microservices infrastructure, follow this order:

### Step 1: Build and Push Docker Images

**Option A: Manual Build (Quick Test)**

```bash
# Navigate to each service directory and build
cd apps/api-auth
docker build -t us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/adyela-staging/adyela/api-auth:latest .
docker push us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/adyela-staging/adyela/api-auth:latest

cd ../api-analytics
docker build -t us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/adyela-staging/adyela/api-analytics:latest .
docker push us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/adyela-staging/adyela/api-analytics:latest

# Repeat for other services...
```

**Option B: Use GitHub Actions Deployment Workflow (RECOMMENDED)**

```bash
# Trigger deployment workflow for specific service
gh workflow run deploy-microservices.yml \
  --field service=api-auth \
  --field environment=staging

# Or deploy all at once
gh workflow run deploy-microservices.yml \
  --field service=all \
  --field environment=staging
```

This will:

1. Build Docker images for all services
2. Push to Artifact Registry
3. Deploy to Cloud Run
4. Run health checks

### Step 2: Verify Docker Images Exist

```bash
# Check that images were pushed successfully
gcloud artifacts docker images list \
  us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/adyela-staging/adyela \
  --include-tags

# Should show:
# - api-auth:latest
# - api-analytics:latest
# - api-admin:latest
# - api-appointments:latest
# - api-payments:latest
# - api-notifications:latest
# - adyela-patient-web-staging:latest
# - adyela-professional-web-staging:latest
```

### Step 3: Re-run Terraform Apply

```bash
cd infra/environments/staging

# Run plan again
terraform plan -out=microservices-retry.tfplan

# Should show fewer resources to create (service accounts already exist)
# Apply
terraform apply microservices-retry.tfplan
```

### Step 4: Verify Load Balancer Routing

```bash
# Test each microservice endpoint
curl -I https://api.staging.adyela.care/auth/health
curl -I https://api.staging.adyela.care/appointments/health
curl -I https://api.staging.adyela.care/payments/health
curl -I https://api.staging.adyela.care/notifications/health
curl -I https://api.staging.adyela.care/admin/health
curl -I https://api.staging.adyela.care/analytics/health

# Test Flutter web apps
curl -I https://patient.staging.adyela.care
curl -I https://professional.staging.adyela.care

# All should return 200 OK
```

## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps (Priority Order)

### P0 - Critical (Do First)

1. **Build and push Docker images** for all microservices
   - Use GitHub Actions deployment workflow
   - OR build manually and push to Artifact Registry

2. **Re-run terraform apply** after images exist
   - Should succeed now that CPU config is fixed
   - Service accounts already created, so faster execution

3. **Test microservices routing** through load balancer
   - Verify path-based routing works
   - Verify SSL certificates are active

### P1 - High Priority (This Week)

4. **Configure DNS for Flutter web apps** in Cloudflare
   - Add CNAME: `patient.staging.adyela.care` → `ghs.googlehosted.com`
   - Add CNAME: `professional.staging.adyela.care` → `ghs.googlehosted.com`
   - Wait for DNS propagation (5-10 minutes)

5. **Deploy Flutter web apps** using deployment workflow

   ```bash
   gh workflow run deploy-flutter-web.yml
   ```

6. **End-to-end testing**
   - Test complete user flows across microservices
   - Verify authentication flow (auth service)
   - Test appointment booking (appointments service)
   - Verify cross-service communication

### P2 - Medium Priority (Next 2 Weeks)

7. **Migrate endpoints from monolith to microservices**
   - Follow Strangler Pattern
   - Migrate one endpoint at a time
   - Monitor error rates and latency

8. **Update frontend API clients**
   - Point to new microservice endpoints
   - Update CORS configuration if needed

9. **Setup monitoring and alerting**
   - Create dashboards for each microservice
   - Configure SLOs (99.5% availability target)
   - Setup cost alerts

## 💰 Cost Implications

**Current State**:

- Service accounts: $0/month (free)
- IAM permissions: $0/month (free)
- Load balancer with routing: ~$18/month (already deployed)

**After Successful Deployment**:

- 6 microservices (scale-to-zero): ~$0-15/month (only when active)
- 2 Flutter web apps (scale-to-zero): ~$0-5/month (only when active)
- **Total incremental cost**: ~$0-20/month for staging environment

**Cost optimization**:

- ✅ Scale-to-zero enabled for all services
- ✅ CPU throttling enabled
- ✅ Reasonable concurrency limits
- ✅ Memory limits optimized

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Image not found" when running terraform apply

**Solution**: Build and push Docker images first (see Step 1 above)

### Issue: "CPU < 1 not supported with concurrency > 1"

**Solution**: ✅ FIXED - Updated api-notifications cpu_limit to "1" in
microservices.tf

### Issue: Load balancer returns 502 Bad Gateway

**Possible causes**:

1. Cloud Run service not deployed yet
2. Service is unhealthy (failing health checks)
3. IAM permissions missing

**Solution**:

```bash
# Check service status
gcloud run services describe api-auth-staging --region=us-central1

# Check health endpoint directly
curl https://api-auth-staging-xxx-uc.a.run.app/health

# Check IAM permissions
gcloud run services get-iam-policy api-auth-staging --region=us-central1
```

### Issue: DNS not resolving for patient/professional subdomains

**Solution**: Add CNAME records in Cloudflare (see
dns-configuration-unified-domain.md)
